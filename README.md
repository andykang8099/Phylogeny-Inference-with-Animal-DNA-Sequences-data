# Phylogeny-Inference-with-Animal-DNA-Sequences-data

This is my statistics thesis research project, Phylogeny Inference with Animal DNA sequences data, under the supervision of Prof. Larget

This project could be categorized to four parts:

1. Construct the Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic trees with GTR, Jukes-Cantor, K2P models with thousands time
bootstrapping using animal DNA sequences data in MrBayes and RAxML.

2. Evaluate the log-likelihood, optimal stationary distribution, transition rates using L-BFGS-B methods with R

3. Alternate the optimal middle branch length in the phylogenetic trees with other possible values and simulated 500 random datasets for
each middle branch length with transformed transition rates using 50 unique animal nucleotide sequences groups (8-10 taxa)

4. Conduct Bootstrap analysis with thousands of iteration time on each dataset and calculat the bootstrap support values
of each possible topology and identified the relationship between the middle branch length and the bootstrap support values
of tree topology with maximum likelihood in the phylogenetic reconstruction
