# Phylogeny-Inference-with-Animal-DNA-data

This is my thesis project regarding the phylogeny inference 

This projcets could be categorized to four parts:

1.Constructed the Maximum-Likelihood phylogenetic trees with GTR, Jukes-Cantor, K2P models with thousands time
bootstrapping using MrBayes and animal DNA sequences data

2.Evaluated the log-likelihood, optimal stationary distribution, transition rates using L-BFGS-B methods with R

3.Alternated the optimal middle branch length in the trees with other possible values and simulated 500 random datasets for
each middle branch length with transformed transition rates using 50 unique animal nucleotide sequences groups

4.Conducted Bootstrap analysis with thousands of iteration time on each dataset and calculated the bootstrap support values
of each possible topology and identified the relationship between the middle branch length and the bootstrap support values
of ML tree topology
